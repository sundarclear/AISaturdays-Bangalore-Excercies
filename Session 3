[Model Classification]
Under Fitting: [High Bias]
Just Right 
Over Fitting, generally clasiffication are very accurate, but Train Dataset accuracy is very high, but Dev Dataset accuracy is very low, then model is not generallized. [High Variance]

Data should be cleaned well during Training phase. Preferably without noise, so the model classification results are not biased.

Train Accuracy mutiple and Test Accuracy helps in training optimization.

For [High Variance] 
[Regularization]

L1 and L2 
COST Function help in cost regularization.
Gradient Descent!!

Drop out Regularization. ("Inverted Dropout"), it helps in reducing High variance.

[Optimizing Training]
Weight Initialization. normalizing the input.
Weight Matrix.
Vanishing or Exploring Gradient.
Managing Training Rate.
